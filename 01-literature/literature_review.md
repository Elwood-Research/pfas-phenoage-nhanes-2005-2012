## Summary of Key Findings by Theme

### 1. PFAS and Biological Aging: Direct Evidence

**Primary Finding**: A landmark 2025 study by Yan et al. provides the first direct evidence linking PFAS exposure to biological aging acceleration using NHANES data.

**Key Study**: Yan et al. (2025) examined 6,846 NHANES participants (2003-2018) and found:
- Significant positive associations between PFHxS and biological aging measured by both KDM-BA (β=0.56, 95% CI: 0.25-0.87) and PhenoAge (β=0.46, 95% CI: 0.08-0.83)
- PFAS mixture exposure positively associated with biological aging (KDM-BA: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04-1.45; PhenoAge: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.55-1.03)
- Nonlinear relationships observed between PFAS and biological aging
- Dietary caffeine may mitigate adverse effects

### 2. PhenoAge as a Biological Aging Biomarker

**Development and Validation**: PhenoAge was developed by Levine et al. (2018) as a clinical biomarker-based measure of biological aging that outperforms chronological age in predicting mortality and disease risk.

**Components**: PhenoAge is calculated using:
- Chronological age
- Albumin
- Creatinine
- Glucose
- C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Lymphocyte percentage
- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)
- Red cell distribution width (RDW)
- Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
- White blood cell count (WBC)

**Predictive Validity**: 
- Strongly predicts all-cause mortality (Levine et al., 2018)
- Associated with cancer risk (Mak et al., 2023)
- Predicts cardiovascular disease outcomes (Zhou et al., 2024)
- Correlated with digestive system cancer risk (Li et al., 2025)

### 3. PFAS and Aging-Related Health Outcomes in NHANES

#### Cardiovascular Disease
- **Wang et al. (2025)**: PFAS exposure associated with cardiovascular risk, with lipid profile as mediator
- **Boafo et al. (2023)**: Combined PFAS and metals exposure significantly elevates CVD risk
- **Mao et al. (2024)**: Me-PFOSA-AcOH exposure associated with coronary heart disease; TLR4 identified as potential molecular target

#### Kidney Disease
- **Adetunji & Obeng-Gyasi (2025)**: PFOS and PFOA negatively associated with eGFR; mixture effects demonstrate cumulative kidney toxicity
- **Haruna & Obeng-Gyasi (2024)**: Combined PFAS and metals associated with chronic kidney disease
- **Rahman et al. (2025)**: MPAH (PFAS metabolite) significantly associated with low eGFR (OR 2.85)

#### Metabolic Dysfunction
- **Bhagavathula et al. (2025)**: PFAS exposure associated with LDL cholesterol alterations
- **Bulka et al. (2021)**: PFAS exposures associated with persistent infections and immune dysfunction
- **Khalil et al. (2015)**: PFAS exposure associated with bone mineral density and osteoporosis risk

#### Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- **Kang et al. (2024)**: PFOS significantly associated with AMD (OR 1.99); non-monotonic dose-response observed

### 4. Mechanisms Linking Environmental Chemicals to Aging

#### Oxidative Stress
- **Tancreda et al. (2025)**: PFAS hepatotoxicity involves oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and PPAR-α activation
- **Ríos-Bonilla et al. (2024)**: PFAS induce neurotoxicity through oxidative stress pathways at environmental concentrations
- **Mazhar et al. (2021)**: Ferroptosis (iron-dependent cell death) implicated in aging; environmental chemicals accelerate this process

#### Inflammation
- **Xu et al. (2025)**: Mitochondrial dysfunction triggers inflammation through DAMPs and inflammasome activation
- **Chen et al. (2022)**: Skeletal muscle aging characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation
- **Mao et al. (2024)**: PFAS activate inflammatory pathways (MAPK, arachidonic acid metabolism) leading to CVD

#### Endocrine Disruption
- **Wu et al. (2024)**: PFAS associated with earlier menopause and decreased estradiol
- **Niemiec et al. (2023)**: Prenatal PFAS exposure leads to epigenetic age acceleration in children
- **Khan et al. (2025)**: PFAS impair placental structure and function during pregnancy

### 5. PFAS Mixture Effects

**Key Finding**: Individual PFAS effects may underestimate total exposure impact due to mixture effects.

**Methodological Approaches**:
- **Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) Regression**: Identifies dominant contributors in mixtures
- **Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR)**: Assesses nonlinear and interaction effects
- **Quantile G-Computation**: Evaluates directional effects of mixtures

**Findings**:
- PFAS mixtures show stronger associations than individual compounds (Yan et al., 2025)
- PFOS typically contributes most weight in cardiovascular and kidney outcomes
- Synergistic effects observed with metals and other environmental pollutants

### 6. Modifying Factors

**Protective Factors**:
- Dietary caffeine may mitigate PFAS-induced biological aging (Yan et al., 2025)
- Higher antioxidant intake associated with reduced biological age acceleration
- Physical activity may reduce PFAS-related COPD risk (Pan et al., 2024)

**Vulnerable Populations**:
- Postmenopausal women (higher PFAS retention)
- Older adults (reduced excretion capacity)
- Individuals with pre-existing kidney disease
- Lower socioeconomic status (higher exposure, limited resources)

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

1. **Longitudinal Studies**: Most evidence is cross-sectional; longitudinal cohorts needed to establish causality
2. **Mechanistic Pathways**: Molecular mechanisms linking PFAS to specific aging biomarkers remain unclear
3. **Mixture Interactions**: Complex chemical interactions require advanced statistical methods
4. **Life Course Perspective**: Early-life PFAS exposure effects on later-life aging trajectories understudied
5. **Intervention Studies**: Strategies to mitigate PFAS-induced biological aging largely unexplored

## Conclusions

This literature review reveals substantial evidence linking PFAS exposure to accelerated biological aging and aging-related diseases. The landmark study by Yan et al. (2025) provides direct epidemiological evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with advanced PhenoAge and KDM-BA in a nationally representative sample. Mechanistic studies suggest oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption as primary pathways. Future research should focus on longitudinal designs, mechanistic investigations, and intervention strategies to mitigate the aging-accelerating effects of PFAS exposure.
