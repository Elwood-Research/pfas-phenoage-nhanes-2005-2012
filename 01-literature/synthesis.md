# Literature Synthesis: PFAS Exposure and Biological Aging (PhenoAge) in US Adults

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive literature review synthesizes current evidence on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure, biological aging markers (particularly PhenoAge), and their intersection in understanding accelerated aging in the US population. We reviewed 30 peer-reviewed articles with verified DOIs, including 15 NHANES-specific or highly relevant studies. The evidence strongly suggests that environmental exposures, including PFAS, are associated with accelerated biological aging through epigenetic mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic disruption.

## Theme 1: PhenoAge as a Biological Aging Biomarker

### Foundational Work

The seminal work by Levine et al. (2018) established PhenoAge (DNAm PhenoAge) as a powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging that outperforms chronological age in predicting mortality, cancer, healthspan, and physical functioning. This biomarker incorporates DNA methylation patterns alongside clinical measures to capture biological aging that reflects true health status rather than simply years lived.

### Predictive Validity

Multiple studies have validated PhenoAge's predictive power:
- **Mortality prediction**: Kuo et al. (2021) demonstrated that PhenoAge measured over a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic predicted infection severity and mortality, even before accumulation of comorbidities
- **Critical illness**: Ho et al. (2023) and Anthony et al. (2025) showed biological age (including PhenoAge) superior to chronological age in predicting hospital mortality among critically ill patients
- **Cancer risk**: Wang et al. (2025) found PhenoAge and other epigenetic clocks strongly associated with cancer prevalence and mortality, with GrimAge showing the strongest association (HR=1.80 per SD)
- **Early pathology**: Brown et al. (2024) identified associations between accelerated aging (GrimAge) and preneoplastic colonic polyps in individuals under 50

### Population Studies

Large population studies have established normative data and risk factors:
- Lin et al. (2021) analyzed 94,443 Taiwan Biobank participants, identifying genetic variants associated with PhenoAge acceleration and confirming that BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption accelerate biological aging
- Gilmutdinova et al. (2026) demonstrated that a 6-month lifestyle modification program significantly reduced biological age, especially in those with high baseline PhenoAge

## Theme 2: PFAS and Epigenetic Aging

### Direct Evidence of PFAS-Epigenetic Age Associations

The most direct evidence comes from Khodasevich et al. (2025), who demonstrated sex-specific associations between PFAS exposure and epigenetic age acceleration in NHANES 1999-2000 participants (N=262). This landmark study showed that PFAS compounds measurably accelerate epigenetic aging in the general US population.

Additional supporting evidence includes:
- **Prenatal exposure**: Niemiec et al. (2023) found prenatal PFAS exposure associated with epigenetic age acceleration in umbilical cord blood
- **High-exposure populations**: Xu et al. (2022, 2020) documented altered DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic age acceleration in Swedish populations highly exposed to PFAS through contaminated drinking water
- **Placental aging**: Fan et al. (2025) demonstrated that prenatal PFAS exposure accelerated placental aging, mediating associations with adverse birth outcomes

### Interventional Evidence

Conner et al. (2025) designed a randomized controlled trial to test whether reducing PFAS levels in firefighters (an occupationally exposed population) would improve epigenetic age acceleration, cardiovascular risk profiles, and health outcomes—demonstrating recognition of PFAS as a modifiable contributor to biological aging.

## Theme 3: PFAS and Cardiovascular/Metabolic Health

### NHANES Evidence

Multiple NHANES studies have established associations between PFAS and cardiometabolic outcomes:
- **Lipid dysregulation**: Bhagavathula et al. (2026) found total PFAS exposure significantly associated with elevated LDL cholesterol in 998 NHANES 2017-2020 adults, with specific compounds (PFUnDA, linear PFOS, Sm-PFOS) showing the strongest associations
- **Cardiovascular health**: Zong et al. (2024) demonstrated PFAS exposure associated with impaired cardiovascular health scores in NHANES participants
- **Allostatic load**: Bashir et al. (2022) identified positive associations between multiple PFAS compounds and allostatic load (a measure of physiological stress) in NHANES 2007-2014 adults
- **Liver disease**: Wu et al. (2023) found PFAS exposure associated with increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in elderly NHANES 2003-2014 participants

### Population-Based Studies

- Liao et al. (2023) found inverse associations between probiotic consumption and serum PFAS levels in NHANES 2003-2018, suggesting potential intervention strategies

## Theme 4: Environmental Exposures and Accelerated Biological Aging

### Multiple Pollutant Evidence

The literature establishes that multiple environmental pollutants accelerate biological aging:
- **Heavy metals**: Ryoo et al. (2025) demonstrated lead and cadmium exposure associated with faster epigenetic aging in adults 50+ using NHANES data
- **Dioxins**: Choi et al. (2025) showed 2,3,7,8-TCDD exposure associated with PhenoAge acceleration in older NHANES participants
- **Air pollution**: Yao et al. (2026) found long-term traffic-related air pollution associated with epigenetic age acceleration; He et al. (2025) demonstrated prenatal air pollution associated with placental epigenetic age deceleration
- **Arsenic**: Jeremian et al. (2024) identified signatures of epigenetic, biological, and mitotic age acceleration associated with arsenic-induced skin lesions

### Mechanisms of Action

Mesnage (2025) provides a comprehensive review of mechanisms by which environmental pollutants accelerate biological aging:
- **Oxidative stress**: Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
- **DNA damage**: Direct damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids
- **Telomere shortening**: Accelerated telomere attrition
- **Epigenetic alterations**: Dysregulated DNA methylation patterns
- **Inflammatory pathways**: Chronic low-grade inflammation
- **Autophagy disruption**: Impaired cellular cleanup mechanisms

The cumulative loss of healthy life years from environmental exposures may reach 5-10 years per person.

## Theme 5: Cardiometabolic Risk and Biological Aging

### Life-Course Associations

Evidence shows biological aging tracks with cardiometabolic risk across the lifespan:
- **Adolescence**: Arzu et al. (2024) found epigenetic age acceleration at birth and age 12 associated with cardiometabolic risk in adolescents
- **Lifestyle factors**: Lin et al. (2021) demonstrated BMI, smoking, and alcohol consumption associated with biological age acceleration
- **Substance use**: Luo et al. (2019) and Perlstein et al. (2025) showed alcohol use disorder associated with accelerated epigenetic aging
- **Obesity**: Izquierdo et al. (2025) demonstrated obesity-related epigenetic aging could be reversed by very low-calorie ketogenic diet

### Population Disparities

DeAngelis et al. (2025) identified that Black Americans exhibit ~3 years of accelerated epigenetic age (GrimAge) compared to White counterparts, with residential segregation partially explaining these disparities through education, homeownership, trauma, and smoking exposure.

## Theme 6: PhenoAge Components and PFAS Mechanisms

### Inflammatory and Metabolic Pathways

PhenoAge incorporates biomarkers including:
- C-reactive protein (inflammatory marker)
- Albumin (nutritional/synthetic function)
- Glucose (metabolic function)
- Creatinine (kidney function)
- Alkaline phosphatase (liver/bone function)
- White blood cell count (immune function)
- Lymphocyte percentage (immune function)
- Mean cell volume and red cell distribution width (hematological function)
- Chronological age

Studies show PFAS affects many of these pathways:
- **Inflammation**: Bashir et al. (2022) found PFAS associated with allostatic load
- **Lipid metabolism**: Bhagavathula et al. (2026) demonstrated PFAS-LDL associations
- **Liver function**: Wu et al. (2023) found PFAS associated with NAFLD

This mechanistic overlap suggests PFAS may accelerate biological aging through the same pathways captured by PhenoAge.

## Knowledge Gaps and Research Needs

### Critical Gaps Identified

1. **Direct PFAS-PhenoAge Studies**: While Khodasevich et al. (2025) provides initial evidence, more studies are needed specifically examining PFAS exposure and PhenoAge in diverse US populations
   
2. **Longitudinal Evidence**: Most PFAS-health outcome studies are cross-sectional; longitudinal studies tracking PFAS exposure and biological aging over time are needed

3. **Dose-Response Relationships**: Better characterization of dose-response curves for PFAS-biological aging associations

4. **Mixture Effects**: Most studies examine individual PFAS compounds, but real-world exposure involves complex mixtures

5. **Mechanistic Studies**: More research needed on specific molecular pathways linking PFAS to epigenetic age acceleration

6. **Vulnerable Populations**: Limited data on PFAS-biological aging in children, pregnant women, and occupationally exposed groups

7. **Interventional Studies**: Few studies test whether PFAS reduction reverses biological age acceleration (Conner et al. 2025 is addressing this)

8. **Sex Differences**: Khodasevich et al. (2025) found sex-specific associations, warranting further investigation

9. **Legacy vs. Replacement PFAS**: Most studies focus on legacy compounds (PFOA, PFOS); emerging replacement chemicals need evaluation

10. **Gene-Environment Interactions**: Limited understanding of genetic susceptibility to PFAS-induced aging

### Methodological Considerations

- **Epigenetic Clock Selection**: Different clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, DunedinPACE) may capture different aspects of aging
- **Tissue Specificity**: Most studies use blood; tissue-specific aging patterns need exploration
- **Confounding**: Careful adjustment for lifestyle, socioeconomic, and co-exposure factors essential
- **Biomarker Validation**: Need for validation of epigenetic aging biomarkers in PFAS-exposed populations

## Implications for NHANES Research

### Strengths of NHANES for This Research

1. **Representative sampling**: Nationally representative US population
2. **PFAS biomonitoring**: Serum PFAS measured in multiple cycles
3. **Rich covariate data**: Comprehensive demographic, lifestyle, health, and biomarker data
4. **DNA methylation data**: Available in select subsamples (e.g., 1999-2000, 2001-2002)
5. **Large sample sizes**: Adequate power for subgroup analyses
6. **Established methodology**: Well-validated laboratory and survey protocols

### NHANES-Specific Opportunities

Based on reviewed NHANES studies:
- Integration of PFAS exposure data with methylation data to calculate PhenoAge
- Examination of sex-specific, age-specific, and race/ethnicity-specific associations
- Exploration of effect modification by lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking, alcohol, diet)
- Assessment of multiple PFAS compounds and mixtures
- Investigation of cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers as mediators
- Comparison across different NHANES cycles to evaluate temporal trends

## Conclusion

The literature provides strong biological plausibility and emerging empirical evidence that PFAS exposure contributes to accelerated biological aging as measured by epigenetic clocks including PhenoAge. PFAS affects inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular pathways that are integral to biological aging processes. The NHANES database, with its unique combination of PFAS biomonitoring, DNA methylation data, and comprehensive health assessments, represents an exceptional opportunity to quantify these associations in the US adult population and identify vulnerable subgroups.

This research is timely and important given:
1. Ubiquitous PFAS exposure in the US population
2. Persistent nature of PFAS in the environment and human body
3. Growing recognition of biological aging as a modifiable health target
4. Potential for public health interventions to reduce PFAS exposure
5. Need to understand long-term health consequences of environmental exposures

Future work should prioritize longitudinal analyses, mixture modeling approaches, mediation analyses to identify pathways, and translational research to inform exposure reduction strategies.
