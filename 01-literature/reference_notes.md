## Literature Synthesis Narrative

The accumulated evidence provides strong support for investigating the association between PFAS exposure and biological aging as measured by PhenoAge in NHANES data. The literature reveals a multi-faceted relationship spanning epidemiological associations, mechanistic pathways, and life-course perspectives.

**Epidemiological Evidence**: The landmark study by Yan et al. (2025) provides the first direct evidence linking PFAS exposure to accelerated biological aging in a nationally representative sample. Using NHANES 2003-2018 data, the study demonstrates significant associations between PFHxS and both PhenoAge and KDM-BA, with mixture analyses showing even stronger effects. This finding builds upon a foundation of studies linking PFAS to individual age-related diseases including cardiovascular disease (Wang et al., 2025; Boafo et al., 2023), kidney disease (Adetunji & Obeng-Gyasi, 2025), and age-related macular degeneration (Kang et al., 2024).

**Mechanistic Framework**: Multiple mechanisms likely mediate the relationship between PFAS and biological aging. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction emerge as central pathways (Tancreda et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025), with PFAS exposure generating reactive oxygen species and impairing mitochondrial function. Inflammation represents another critical mechanism, with studies identifying activation of NF-κB, MAPK, and TLR4 pathways (Mao et al., 2024). The anti-aging protein Klotho may also play a role, with PFAS exposure inversely associated with serum Klotho levels (Li et al., 2023). Novel mechanisms such as ferroptosis (iron-dependent cell death) provide additional explanatory frameworks (Mazhar et al., 2021).

**Developmental Origins**: Evidence suggests PFAS effects on aging may begin in utero. Prenatal PFAS exposure has been associated with epigenetic age acceleration in children (Niemiec et al., 2023), supporting the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. This life-course perspective emphasizes that biological aging is not simply a later-life phenomenon but a cumulative process influenced by early exposures.

**Mixture Considerations**: The literature consistently demonstrates that PFAS mixture effects exceed individual compound effects (Yan et al., 2025; Boafo et al., 2023). This finding has critical implications for risk assessment and regulatory policy, as current approaches typically evaluate PFAS individually. Advanced statistical methods including Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression, and quantile g-computation enable characterization of these complex mixture effects.

**Vulnerable Populations**: Certain subgroups may be particularly susceptible to PFAS-induced aging acceleration. Postmenopausal women show higher PFAS retention due to cessation of menstruation (major excretion route). Individuals with reduced kidney function have impaired PFAS clearance, leading to higher body burdens. Lower socioeconomic status groups may experience higher exposures while having limited resources for risk mitigation.

**Modifying Factors**: Not all individuals exposed to PFAS show equivalent aging acceleration, suggesting important modifying factors. Higher dietary caffeine intake appears protective (Yan et al., 2025), possibly through antioxidant mechanisms. Physical activity may also reduce PFAS-related health risks (Pan et al., 2024). These findings suggest potential intervention strategies to mitigate PFAS effects.

**Study Implications**: The current study builds upon this literature foundation by examining the PFAS-PhenoAge association with rigorous statistical methods. The validated PhenoAge measure (Levine et al., 2018) provides a robust outcome that predicts mortality and disease risk better than chronological age. Using NHANES data ensures generalizability to the U.S. adult population. Incorporation of mixture analysis methods addresses the reality of multi-chemical exposures. Investigation of effect modification by sex, age, and other factors identifies vulnerable subgroups.

**Future Directions**: This literature review identifies several priority areas for future research. Longitudinal cohort studies are needed to establish temporal relationships and causal inference. Mechanistic studies should investigate specific pathways linking PFAS to PhenoAge biomarkers. Intervention studies examining caffeine, antioxidants, and other protective factors could inform public health recommendations. Finally, regulatory approaches should consider mixture effects and vulnerable populations in risk assessment frameworks.
