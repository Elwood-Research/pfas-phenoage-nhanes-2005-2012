## Key Themes Identified

### 1. **PhenoAge as Biological Aging Biomarker**
- Levine et al. 2018: Foundational work (2638+ citations)
- Validated across multiple populations and outcomes
- Superior to chronological age for mortality, disease, and healthspan prediction
- Integrates 9 clinical biomarkers with DNA methylation (513 CpGs)

### 2. **PFAS and Epigenetic Aging - Direct Evidence**
- Khodasevich et al. 2025: First NHANES evidence of PFAS-epigenetic age associations (sex-specific)
- Niemiec et al. 2023: Prenatal PFAS exposure → cord blood epigenetic age acceleration
- Xu et al. 2022, 2020: High-exposure populations show DNA methylation changes
- Conner et al. 2025: RCT protocol testing PFAS reduction on aging reversal

### 3. **PFAS and Cardiometabolic Pathways**
- LDL cholesterol elevation (Bhagavathula 2026)
- Allostatic load increase (Bashir 2022)
- NAFLD risk (Wu 2023)
- Cardiovascular health impairment (Zong 2024)
- Mechanistic overlap with PhenoAge components

### 4. **Environmental Exposures Accelerate Aging**
- Heavy metals (Ryoo 2025)
- Dioxins (Choi 2025)
- Air pollution (Yao 2026, He 2025)
- Arsenic (Jeremian 2024)
- Cumulative impact: 5-10 years healthy life lost (Mesnage 2025)

### 5. **Modifiable Risk Factors**
- Lifestyle: BMI, smoking, alcohol (Lin 2021)
- Dietary interventions possible (Liao 2023, Izquierdo 2025)
- Biological age reversibility demonstrated (Gilmutdinova 2026)

### 6. **Health Disparities**
- Racial/ethnic differences (DeAngelis 2025)
- Socioeconomic factors
- Residential segregation impacts

## Major Findings

### Strong Evidence:
✅ PhenoAge is a validated, powerful biological aging biomarker  
✅ PFAS exposure associated with epigenetic aging in NHANES population  
✅ PFAS disrupts cardiovascular and metabolic pathways integral to PhenoAge  
✅ Environmental pollutants broadly accelerate biological aging  
✅ Biological aging is modifiable through interventions  

### Mechanistic Pathways:
- Oxidative stress → ROS production
- Chronic inflammation (↑ CRP)
- Lipid dysregulation (↑ LDL)
- Metabolic disruption (glucose, liver function)
- Telomere shortening
- DNA methylation alterations
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Immune dysregulation

## Critical Knowledge Gaps

1. **Limited Direct PFAS-PhenoAge Studies:** Only one NHANES study (Khodasevich 2025) directly examines this association
2. **Longitudinal Data Needed:** Most studies cross-sectional; temporal relationships unclear
3. **Dose-Response Curves:** Better characterization needed across PFAS exposure ranges
4. **Mixture Effects:** Real-world co-exposure to multiple PFAS not well-studied
5. **Molecular Mechanisms:** Specific pathways linking PFAS to epigenetic clocks need elucidation
6. **Vulnerable Populations:** Limited data on children, pregnant women, occupational groups
7. **Reversibility:** Few intervention studies testing if PFAS reduction reverses aging
8. **Sex/Gender Differences:** Khodasevich found sex-specific effects; more research needed
9. **Legacy vs. Emerging PFAS:** Most focus on PFOA/PFOS; replacement chemicals understudied
10. **Gene-Environment Interactions:** Genetic susceptibility poorly characterized

## Research Justification

This literature review strongly supports the proposed NHANES study examining PFAS exposure and PhenoAge because:

1. **Biological Plausibility:** Multiple mechanistic pathways link PFAS to aging processes
2. **Preliminary Evidence:** Khodasevich et al. 2025 provides proof-of-concept in NHANES
3. **Public Health Relevance:** Ubiquitous PFAS exposure in US population
4. **Modifiable Risk Factor:** Understanding may inform interventions
5. **Data Availability:** NHANES provides unique combination of PFAS, methylation, and health data
6. **Health Equity:** Can identify vulnerable subpopulations
7. **Timely:** Growing concern about PFAS and early-onset chronic diseases
8. **Novel Contribution:** Will expand limited evidence base significantly

## Methodological Insights for Proposed Study

### Strengths to Leverage:
- NHANES representative sampling
- Validated PhenoAge calculation
- Multiple PFAS compounds measured
- Rich covariate data (lifestyle, sociodemographic, health)
- Established epigenetic clock methodology

### Analytical Considerations:
- Adjust for key confounders (age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, SES)
- Consider sex-stratified analyses (Khodasevich finding)
- Examine individual PFAS and mixtures
- Test dose-response relationships
- Explore mediation by cardiometabolic biomarkers
- Compare multiple epigenetic clocks (PhenoAge, GrimAge, Horvath, etc.)
- Address multicollinearity among PFAS compounds

### Expected Contributions:
1. Quantify PFAS-PhenoAge associations in recent US population
2. Identify which PFAS compounds most strongly associated
3. Characterize vulnerable subgroups
4. Elucidate potential mediating pathways
5. Inform PFAS exposure reduction policies
6. Advance understanding of environmental aging
