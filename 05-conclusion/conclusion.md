# Conclusion

This cross-sectional study examined associations between serum concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and biological aging as measured by PhenoAge acceleration in 3,198 U.S. adults from NHANES 2005-2012. Contrary to our primary hypothesis and prior literature, we observed inverse associations between all four measured PFAS compounds (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) and PhenoAge acceleration after adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, each log-unit increase in PFOA was associated with a 0.94-year decrease in PhenoAge acceleration in fully adjusted models, with similar patterns for other PFAS compounds. These associations persisted after adjustment for health behaviors and chronic conditions, and demonstrated stronger effects in females compared to males and in older adults (≥50 years) compared to younger adults.

These unexpected inverse associations diverge from the landmark findings of Yan et al. (2025), who reported positive associations between PFAS exposure and biological aging measures in a larger NHANES sample spanning 1999-2018, and contradict mechanistic evidence demonstrating that PFAS induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and endocrine disruption—pathways implicated in accelerated biological aging (Tancreda et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025; Mao et al., 2024). The discrepancy between our findings and the broader PFAS toxicology literature highlights fundamental methodological challenges in cross-sectional environmental epidemiology and underscores the need for cautious interpretation of observational associations.

Several alternative explanations merit consideration beyond a protective effect of PFAS exposure, which would be inconsistent with extensive evidence of PFAS toxicity across multiple organ systems. First, survival bias may have selected for individuals who are resilient to PFAS-associated health effects, as those most vulnerable to PFAS toxicity may have experienced excess mortality and been excluded from the study population. Second, reverse causation is plausible, whereby individuals with accelerated biological aging exhibit altered PFAS toxicokinetics due to compromised renal or hepatic function, leading to spurious inverse associations. Third, residual confounding from unmeasured variables—particularly dietary quality, occupational exposures, and geographic contamination patterns—may have obscured or reversed true adverse associations. Fourth, non-monotonic dose-response relationships, as documented for other PFAS-health outcome pairs (Kang et al., 2024), may operate such that linear modeling approaches inadequately capture complex exposure-response patterns. Finally, temporal changes in PFAS exposure profiles following industry phase-outs in the mid-2000s may have resulted in differential exposure-outcome relationships in our 2005-2012 sample compared to other time periods.

The methodological limitations of this study are substantial and constrain the strength of conclusions that can be drawn. The cross-sectional design precludes establishment of temporal precedence between PFAS exposure and PhenoAge acceleration, as both were measured at a single time point. Single measurements of PFAS concentrations may inadequately represent long-term cumulative exposure or capture critical windows of susceptibility during early life, when PFAS exposures may program aging trajectories that manifest decades later (Niemiec et al., 2023; Khan et al., 2025). The use of PhenoAge as the sole measure of biological aging, while validated and predictive of mortality and morbidity outcomes (Levine et al., 2018; Mak et al., 2023), represents only one dimension of the multifaceted aging phenotype; incorporation of complementary aging measures including epigenetic clocks, telomere length, and multi-omics signatures would provide a more comprehensive assessment of PFAS aging effects (Belsky et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2024).

Despite these limitations, our study makes important contributions to the PFAS-biological aging literature. The use of NHANES data ensures findings are generalizable to the U.S. adult population, with rigorous probability sampling, standardized protocols, and high-quality laboratory measurements. The examination of multiple PFAS compounds individually, rather than focusing on a single exposure, allows comparison of effects across chemical structures and assessment of consistency of associations. The comprehensive covariate adjustment strategy, including demographic factors, socioeconomic indicators, health behaviors, and chronic conditions, addresses known confounders and demonstrates robustness of findings across model specifications. The sex-stratified and age-stratified analyses reveal important heterogeneity in associations that may reflect differential vulnerability and warrant further investigation in studies designed to identify biological mechanisms underlying sex-specific and age-specific PFAS effects.

From a public health perspective, these findings should not be interpreted as evidence of PFAS safety or as justification for reduced regulatory attention to PFAS contamination. The weight of evidence from mechanistic studies demonstrating PFAS-induced cellular damage, animal toxicology studies showing adverse health outcomes across multiple organ systems, and human health research documenting associations with cardiovascular disease, kidney dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and cancer risk (Wang et al., 2025; Adetunji &amp; Obeng-Gyasi, 2025; Wen et al., 2023) overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that PFAS exposure poses significant health risks. Precautionary approaches to PFAS exposure reduction—through regulatory limits on drinking water contamination, restrictions on PFAS use in food packaging and consumer products, remediation of contaminated sites, and development of safer alternatives—remain essential public health priorities. Healthcare providers should continue to counsel patients, particularly pregnant women, children, and individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease, on strategies to minimize PFAS exposure through dietary choices, water filtration, and avoidance of PFAS-containing products.

Future research priorities should focus on addressing the methodological limitations that constrain causal inference in the current study. Prospective longitudinal cohort studies with repeated measurements of PFAS exposure and biological aging markers over time are essential for establishing temporal relationships, characterizing exposure trajectories, assessing within-person changes in aging rates, and minimizing survival bias through careful attention to loss-to-follow-up patterns. Comprehensive life course studies measuring PFAS exposure from prenatal development through older adulthood would elucidate critical windows of susceptibility and cumulative exposure effects not captured by single adult measurements. Mechanistic research integrating multiple biological aging measures—including epigenetic clocks, telomere length, transcriptomic and proteomic aging signatures, and metabolomic profiles—alongside detailed assessment of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, and mitochondrial function would provide more definitive evidence of pathways through which PFAS may influence biological aging processes.

Advanced statistical approaches including Mendelian randomization using genetic variants associated with PFAS concentrations as instrumental variables could strengthen causal inference by addressing confounding, though identifying suitable genetic instruments with sufficient strength and validity represents a significant challenge (Schooling et al., 2025). Natural experiments leveraging communities that transitioned from contaminated to clean drinking water sources, or occupational cohorts with reduced workplace PFAS exposures following regulatory changes, could provide quasi-experimental evidence on the reversibility of PFAS-associated health effects and inform policy decisions about the urgency and magnitude of benefits from remediation efforts. Intervention studies examining whether PFAS exposure reduction slows biological aging trajectories would provide the strongest evidence for causal relationships and guide preventive strategies.

The broader context of environmental determinants of biological aging requires attention to the complex mixtures of chemical exposures that characterize real-world human experience. PFAS exposure co-occurs with exposure to heavy metals, phthalates, brominated flame retardants, and other persistent organic pollutants, and these chemicals may exert interactive effects on aging processes through shared mechanistic pathways involving oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption (Boafo et al., 2023; Odediran et al., 2025; Fei et al., 2025). Future research should employ mixture analysis approaches—including weighted quantile sum regression, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and quantile g-computation—to characterize cumulative environmental chemical exposures and their joint effects on biological aging. An exposome perspective that situates chemical exposures within broader social-environmental contexts, including psychosocial stress, neighborhood characteristics, dietary patterns, and access to healthcare, would provide the most comprehensive understanding of modifiable determinants of biological aging (Cuevas et al., 2025).

Emerging evidence that lifestyle factors may modify PFAS-associated health risks offers hope for intervention even in the absence of complete exposure elimination. Moderate caffeine consumption (Yan et al., 2025), regular physical activity (Pan et al., 2024), and diets rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds (He et al., 2025) may mitigate adverse effects of PFAS exposure by counteracting oxidative stress and inflammation. While these behavioral interventions do not address root causes of environmental contamination and should not substitute for regulatory action to reduce PFAS production and release, they provide practical risk reduction strategies for highly exposed populations. Public health messaging should emphasize both primary prevention through exposure reduction and secondary prevention through resilience-building health behaviors.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the emerging literature on environmental determinants of biological aging by examining associations between PFAS exposure and PhenoAge acceleration in a nationally representative U.S. sample. The unexpected inverse associations observed highlight the complexities and challenges of inferring causal relationships from cross-sectional environmental epidemiology data, particularly for exposures that accumulate over decades and outcomes that reflect multifaceted physiological processes. While our findings diverge from mechanistic expectations and prior epidemiologic evidence, they underscore the critical importance of methodological rigor, cautious interpretation, and triangulation across multiple lines of evidence—including animal studies, mechanistic research, and well-designed human observational and interventional studies—in characterizing environmental health risks. The urgent need for prospective longitudinal studies with comprehensive exposure assessment, multi-dimensional biological aging measures, and sophisticated causal inference approaches remains clear. Until such evidence becomes available, public health action to reduce PFAS exposure through regulatory intervention, technological innovation, and individual behavioral change represents a prudent approach to protecting population health from these persistent environmental contaminants.
