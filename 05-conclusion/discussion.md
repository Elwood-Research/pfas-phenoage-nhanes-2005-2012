# Discussion

## Overview of Findings

This cross-sectional study examined the association between serum concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and biological aging as measured by PhenoAge acceleration in 3,198 U.S. adults from NHANES 2005-2012. Our principal finding was that all four measured PFAS compounds—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)—demonstrated significant inverse associations with PhenoAge acceleration after adjusting for demographics and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, each log-unit increase in PFOA was associated with a 0.94-year decrease in PhenoAge acceleration in fully adjusted models (Model 2), with PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA showing similar patterns. These associations persisted after additional adjustment for socioeconomic status, health behaviors, and chronic health conditions, suggesting robust relationships that warrant careful interpretation within the broader context of PFAS toxicology and biological aging research.

Contrary to our primary hypothesis and the landmark findings of Yan et al. (2025), who reported positive associations between PFHxS and PhenoAge (β=0.46, 95% CI: 0.08-0.83) in NHANES participants, our results indicated inverse associations. This unexpected directionality requires contextualization within the complexities of cross-sectional study designs, potential confounding structures, and the multifaceted nature of biological aging biomarkers. While inverse associations might superficially suggest protective effects of PFAS exposure, such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the extensive toxicological literature demonstrating adverse health effects of PFAS across multiple organ systems (Tancreda et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Adetunji &amp; Obeng-Gyasi, 2025). Alternative explanations including survival bias, reverse causation, and residual confounding must be carefully considered.

## Interpretation in Context of Existing Literature

### Comparison with Prior PFAS-Aging Research

The discrepancy between our findings and those of Yan et al. (2025) merits detailed examination. Yan and colleagues analyzed NHANES data from 1999-2018 (n=6,846 participants) and found positive associations between PFHxS and biological aging measures, as well as positive mixture effects. Several methodological differences may contribute to divergent findings. First, our study utilized NHANES cycles 2005-2012 (n=3,198), representing a different temporal window with potentially distinct exposure patterns and population characteristics. The decline in legacy PFAS concentrations following the voluntary phase-out of PFOA and PFOS production by major manufacturers in the mid-2000s (Botelho et al., 2025) may have resulted in differential exposure-outcome relationships across time periods. Second, differences in covariate adjustment strategies, analytical approaches to handling survey weights, and treatment of missing data could influence effect estimates and their interpretation.

Importantly, biological aging represents a complex phenotype that may exhibit non-monotonic dose-response relationships with environmental exposures. Kang et al. (2024) documented non-monotonic associations between PFOS and age-related macular degeneration in NHANES 2005-2008, demonstrating inverted U-shaped dose-response curves for certain PFAS-health outcome relationships. Such non-linearity could arise from multiple toxicological mechanisms operating at different concentration ranges, including receptor-mediated effects, hormetic responses, and threshold phenomena (Wen et al., 2023). Our linear modeling approach, while consistent with conventional epidemiologic practice, may not fully capture complex exposure-response patterns that could reconcile apparent contradictions across studies.

### Integration with PFAS Health Effects Literature

Despite the inverse associations observed in our study, the broader literature provides compelling evidence for adverse health effects of PFAS exposure across multiple domains relevant to aging. Wang et al. (2025) demonstrated that PFAS exposure was associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk through lipid-mediated pathways in NHANES 2015-2020 (n=25,531). Adetunji and Obeng-Gyasi (2025) reported positive associations between PFAS mixtures and chronic kidney disease using Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) methods, with evidence of synergistic effects among co-exposures. Mao et al. (2024) identified Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a molecular target through which PFAS metabolites promote cardiovascular disease via inflammatory pathways, providing mechanistic support for PFAS-associated pathology.

These findings align with established mechanisms of biological aging, including chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Xu et al., 2025). PhenoAge incorporates biomarkers sensitive to these processes, including C-reactive protein (inflammation), glucose (metabolic dysregulation), and albumin (nutritional status and inflammation). The disconnect between mechanistic expectations and our epidemiologic findings suggests the need for careful consideration of study design limitations and alternative explanatory frameworks.

## Biological Mechanisms and Plausibility

### Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction

PFAS compounds have been shown to induce oxidative stress and disrupt mitochondrial function through multiple pathways. Tancreda et al. (2025) provided a comprehensive review of PFAS hepatotoxicity mechanisms, identifying oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and dysregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) signaling as central mediators. PFAS exposure increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, compromises mitochondrial membrane potential, and impairs oxidative phosphorylation—processes that are hallmarks of cellular aging (Xu et al., 2025). These molecular perturbations would be expected to accelerate biological aging by damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids, promoting cellular senescence, and impairing tissue repair capacity.

Mazhar et al. (2021) highlighted the role of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, in aging processes. PFAS compounds, particularly perfluorinated carboxylic acids like PFOA, may trigger ferroptotic pathways through oxidative stress induction and disruption of antioxidant defense systems. The PhenoAge algorithm incorporates mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and red cell distribution width (RDW), erythrocyte parameters that may be influenced by oxidative damage and iron metabolism dysregulation. However, the directionality of these associations in the context of PFAS exposure remains incompletely characterized.

### Chronic Inflammation and Immune Dysregulation

Chronic low-grade inflammation is a central feature of biological aging and is captured by PhenoAge through C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count. Mao et al. (2024) demonstrated that PFAS metabolites activate pro-inflammatory signaling through TLR4, initiating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation and cytokine production. This inflammatory cascade contributes to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and tissue damage—processes that accelerate biological aging and increase mortality risk (Levine et al., 2018).

Bulka et al. (2021) reported associations between PFAS exposure and increased risk of persistent infections in NHANES participants, suggesting immune system dysfunction. Altered lymphocyte percentages, a PhenoAge component, may reflect PFAS-induced immunomodulation. However, the complexity of immune system responses to environmental exposures complicates straightforward interpretations. PFAS compounds can exhibit both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory effects depending on exposure levels, timing, and individual susceptibility factors, potentially contributing to non-monotonic or paradoxical associations in population-based studies.

### Endocrine Disruption and Metabolic Dysregulation

PFAS compounds function as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with documented effects on thyroid hormones, sex steroids, and metabolic regulation (Wu et al., 2024). Wu and colleagues demonstrated that PFAS exposure was associated with earlier menopause and decreased estradiol levels in females, representing a sex-specific pathway to accelerated reproductive and biological aging. Levine et al. (2016) established that menopause accelerates biological aging by approximately 6%, providing biological plausibility for PFAS-mediated aging through endocrine disruption.

Li et al. (2023) reported inverse associations between PFAS exposure and serum alpha-Klotho, an anti-aging protein with cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and metabolic regulatory functions. Klotho suppression represents a mechanistic link between PFAS exposure and accelerated aging that operates independently of the specific biomarkers included in PhenoAge calculation. This pathway may contribute to long-term aging effects not fully captured by cross-sectional biomarker assessments.

Glucose dysregulation, reflected in PhenoAge through fasting glucose measurements, represents another mechanism through which PFAS may influence biological aging. Bhagavathula et al. (2025) documented associations between PFAS exposure and dyslipidemia, while Wan et al. (2024) demonstrated links to metabolic syndrome. These metabolic perturbations accumulate over time and contribute to accelerated physiological decline, organ damage, and increased disease susceptibility.

## Methodological Considerations and Limitations

### Cross-Sectional Design and Temporal Ambiguity

The cross-sectional nature of our study represents a fundamental limitation that constrains causal inference. Cross-sectional designs cannot establish temporal precedence between exposure and outcome, creating ambiguity about whether PFAS exposure preceded PhenoAge acceleration or whether underlying health status influenced both PFAS levels and biological aging markers. PFAS compounds exhibit relatively long biological half-lives (2-8 years for legacy compounds; Botelho et al., 2025), suggesting that measured serum concentrations reflect cumulative exposure over years. However, PhenoAge components represent current physiological state and may be influenced by recent acute illnesses, medications, dietary intake, and other time-varying factors not fully captured by covariate adjustment.

Reverse causation represents a plausible alternative explanation for inverse associations. Individuals with accelerated biological aging may exhibit altered PFAS toxicokinetics due to compromised renal function, hepatic metabolism, or body composition changes. Moon (2022) demonstrated complex relationships between PFAS exposure and kidney function using causal inference methods in NHANES data, highlighting bidirectional pathways that complicate straightforward exposure-outcome interpretations. Participants with chronic kidney disease show reduced PFAS clearance and higher body burdens (Haruna &amp; Obeng-Gyasi, 2024), yet our study excluded participants based on extreme outlier criteria rather than clinical diagnoses, potentially retaining individuals with subclinical disease.

### Survival Bias and Healthy Participant Effects

Survival bias represents a critical concern in cross-sectional aging research. Participants who survive to middle and older ages with measurable PFAS exposure may represent a selected subset of the exposed population who are more resilient to PFAS toxicity. If PFAS exposure causes excess mortality through cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other age-related conditions (Mak et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024), individuals remaining in the study population may exhibit protective genetic variants, health behaviors, or other characteristics that mitigate PFAS adverse effects. This selection process would bias observed associations toward the null or potentially create spurious inverse associations if survival probability is associated with both PFAS exposure and resilience to biological aging.

The healthy participant effect may further contribute to paradoxical findings. NHANES participants who complete examination protocols, provide biological samples, and maintain fasting requirements for laboratory assessments may differ systematically from non-participants in ways that relate to both PFAS exposure and biological aging. Higher socioeconomic status individuals, who tend to have better health status and lower biological aging, may also have higher PFAS exposure through dietary patterns (seafood consumption, processed foods), occupational exposures, or residential proximity to PFAS contamination sources (Gu et al., 2025). These complex sociodemographic patterning of exposure and outcome could generate confounding structures not fully addressed by conventional covariate adjustment.

### Residual Confounding and Unmeasured Variables

Despite adjustment for demographics, socioeconomic factors, health behaviors, and chronic conditions, residual confounding remains a substantial concern. Dietary quality, a critical determinant of both biological aging and PFAS exposure, was not comprehensively controlled in our models. PFAS exposure occurs primarily through dietary sources, including seafood, processed foods packaged in PFAS-containing materials, and contaminated drinking water (Odediran et al., 2025). Individuals consuming high-quality diets rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and anti-inflammatory compounds may exhibit both higher PFAS exposure (through seafood consumption) and slower biological aging (through nutritional benefits), creating positive confounding that could mask or reverse true adverse associations.

Occupational exposures represent another domain of unmeasured confounding. Gu et al. (2025) documented substantial variation in PFAS concentrations across occupational groups in NHANES 2005-2014, with elevated exposures in certain industries and professions. Occupational exposures may be associated with socioeconomic advantages (income, benefits, access to healthcare) that protect against biological aging while simultaneously increasing PFAS body burden. NHANES collects limited occupational data, precluding detailed assessment of workplace exposures and their confounding potential.

Geographic variation in PFAS contamination sources, including proximity to military bases, industrial facilities, and contaminated water supplies, introduces spatial confounding not captured by NHANES design. Schultz et al. (2023) demonstrated substantial geographic heterogeneity in PFAS exposure patterns when comparing Wisconsin biomonitoring data to NHANES national estimates. Local environmental justice concerns, where marginalized communities experience disproportionate PFAS exposure alongside elevated baseline disease risk, may be obscured in nationally aggregated analyses that assume homogeneous exposure-outcome relationships.

### Measurement Error and Biomarker Variability

PFAS measurements and PhenoAge biomarkers are subject to measurement error that may bias associations in unpredictable ways. PFAS concentrations exhibit within-person variability over time due to changes in exposure sources, dietary patterns, and physiological states. Single time-point measurements may misclassify true long-term exposure, attenuating observed associations (classical measurement error) or introducing complex bias patterns if measurement error is differential by age, health status, or other characteristics.

PhenoAge components demonstrate biological variability influenced by acute illness, inflammation, hydration status, time of day, and laboratory analytical variation. The composite nature of PhenoAge, while providing a multisystem assessment of biological aging, also introduces complexity in interpreting associations with environmental exposures. Different PFAS compounds may exert differential effects on specific PhenoAge components—for example, PFOA may primarily influence liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase) while PFOS affects renal function (creatinine)—and these component-specific effects may cancel out when aggregated into the overall PhenoAge score.

Laboratory method changes across NHANES cycles introduce additional measurement variability. Although we attempted to harmonize biomarker measurements across cycles, changes in analytical instrumentation, calibration standards, and quality control procedures may create systematic differences in measured values that are unrelated to true biological variation. Detection limits for PFAS decreased over the study period (from 0.1-0.2 ng/mL in early cycles to 0.07-0.14 ng/mL in later cycles), potentially affecting exposure classification and dose-response characterization, particularly at lower concentration ranges.

## Strengths and Contributions

### Nationally Representative Sample and Rigorous Methodology

Despite limitations, our study provides valuable contributions to the PFAS-biological aging literature. The use of NHANES data ensures nationally representative findings generalizable to the U.S. adult population, with rigorous probability sampling, standardized protocols, and high-quality laboratory measurements. Our analytic sample of 3,198 participants provides adequate statistical power to detect associations and examine effect modification by demographic characteristics. The application of appropriate survey weights, variance estimation procedures (accounting for complex sampling design through strata and primary sampling units), and outlier handling protocols ensures methodological rigor consistent with best practices in environmental epidemiology.

The incorporation of PhenoAge, a validated biological aging measure with established predictive validity for mortality, cancer, cardiovascular events, and functional decline (Levine et al., 2018; Mak et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024), represents a strength relative to studies examining single biomarkers or clinical outcomes. PhenoAge integrates information across multiple physiological systems—hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematologic, and inflammatory—providing a comprehensive assessment of biological aging that may be more sensitive to systemic effects of environmental exposures than organ-specific outcomes.

### Comprehensive Covariate Adjustment and Sensitivity Analyses

Our analytical approach incorporated progressive covariate adjustment to assess confounding structures and explore robustness of findings. Model 1 (crude associations adjusted for age and sex) established baseline relationships, Model 2 added demographic factors to address known social determinants of health, and Model 3 incorporated socioeconomic and health behavior variables to control for lifestyle confounding. The persistence of inverse associations across adjustment models suggests these findings are not fully explained by measured confounders, though residual confounding from unmeasured variables remains possible.

Sex-stratified analyses revealed important heterogeneity in associations. Inverse associations were stronger in females (PFOA: β=-1.05, p&lt;0.001) compared to males (PFOA: β=-0.50, p=0.040), consistent with sex-specific PFAS toxicokinetics and vulnerability patterns documented in prior literature (Wu et al., 2024; Arredondo Eve et al., 2024). Women exhibit higher PFAS concentrations during reproductive years due to hormonal influences on distribution and excretion, while postmenopausal women show reduced clearance capacity. The sex-specific patterns observed in our study warrant further investigation in longitudinal cohorts that can separate age, period, and cohort effects while accounting for reproductive history, hormone therapy use, and other sex-specific exposures.

Age-stratified analyses demonstrated stronger inverse associations in older adults (≥50 years: PFOA β=-1.12) compared to younger adults (&lt;50 years: PFOA β=-0.52), suggesting age-dependent relationships that may reflect cumulative exposure effects, altered toxicokinetics with aging, or survival bias operating more strongly in older age groups. These findings highlight the importance of considering life course perspectives in environmental aging research, recognizing that exposures accumulate over time and their health impacts may manifest differentially across the lifespan (Niemiec et al., 2023).

### PFAS Mixture Complexity

Although our WQS mixture analysis did not yield the expected positive mixture effects reported by Yan et al. (2025), the attempt to address real-world mixture exposures represents a methodological strength. Humans are simultaneously exposed to multiple PFAS compounds through diverse exposure pathways, and traditional single-chemical risk assessment approaches may inadequately characterize cumulative health impacts (Ríos-Bonilla et al., 2024). Future studies should employ advanced mixture methods including Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to model non-linear exposure-response relationships and chemical interactions, or quantile g-computation to estimate joint effects while accounting for directional heterogeneity among mixture components (Adetunji &amp; Obeng-Gyasi, 2025; Balogun &amp; Obeng-Gyasi, 2024).

The four PFAS compounds examined in our study—PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA—represent legacy fluorinated substances that have been the focus of regulatory action and voluntary industry phase-outs. However, emerging PFAS replacements, including shorter-chain compounds and novel structural variants, are increasingly detected in environmental and human biomonitoring studies (Botelho et al., 2025). The toxicological profiles of these replacement chemicals remain incompletely characterized, and their potential contributions to biological aging warrant investigation as biomonitoring data become available in future NHANES cycles.

## Clinical and Public Health Implications

### Interpretation Caution and Research Priorities

The inverse associations observed in our study should not be interpreted as evidence of PFAS safety or protective effects. The weight of evidence from mechanistic studies, animal toxicology, and human health research consistently demonstrates adverse effects of PFAS exposure across multiple organ systems and health outcomes (Tancreda et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Wen et al., 2023). Our findings more likely reflect methodological limitations of cross-sectional designs, residual confounding, or complex non-monotonic dose-response relationships than true protective effects.

From a public health perspective, precautionary approaches to PFAS exposure reduction remain justified and necessary. PFAS contamination of drinking water, food packaging, consumer products, and occupational settings represents a modifiable environmental risk factor amenable to regulatory intervention, technological innovation, and behavioral change. The EPA's establishment of enforceable drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, state-level regulations restricting PFAS in food contact materials and firefighting foam, and industry efforts to develop safer alternatives all contribute to reducing population exposure and associated health risks.

Clinically, our findings do not alter recommendations for PFAS exposure reduction in high-risk populations. Pregnant women, children, and individuals with pre-existing kidney or liver disease should minimize PFAS exposure through dietary choices (limiting processed foods, choosing PFAS-free food packaging), water filtration (using activated carbon or reverse osmosis systems in contaminated areas), and avoidance of PFAS-containing consumer products (stain-resistant textiles, non-stick cookware). Healthcare providers should remain informed about local PFAS contamination issues and incorporate exposure assessment and reduction counseling into clinical encounters with vulnerable patients.

### Vulnerable Populations and Environmental Justice

Despite the unexpected directionality of overall associations, our sex-stratified and age-stratified analyses highlight differential vulnerability patterns that have important environmental justice implications. The stronger associations observed in females and older adults align with established biological mechanisms of sex-specific endocrine disruption and age-related declines in detoxification capacity (Wu et al., 2024; Levine et al., 2016). These findings suggest the need for targeted public health interventions that address the specific vulnerabilities of women, particularly during reproductive and postmenopausal years, and older adults with compromised renal function.

Socioeconomic disparities in PFAS exposure and health outcomes represent an environmental justice concern requiring policy attention. Lower-income communities and communities of color often experience disproportionate PFAS contamination due to proximity to industrial facilities, military bases, and waste disposal sites, combined with reduced resources for exposure mitigation and healthcare access (Cuevas et al., 2025). While our study adjusted for poverty-income ratio and education, these measures may inadequately capture the cumulative impacts of structural racism, residential segregation, and environmental injustice that shape both exposures and health resilience.

### Future Research Directions and Study Design Recommendations

Resolving the apparent contradictions between our findings and prior literature requires prospective longitudinal studies that measure PFAS exposure and biological aging markers repeatedly over time. Cohort designs with multiple assessment waves can establish temporal relationships, characterize exposure trajectories, assess within-person changes in biological aging rates, and minimize survival bias through careful attention to loss-to-follow-up patterns. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, and other well-established cohorts with stored biospecimens could be leveraged for retrospective PFAS measurements linked to longitudinal aging marker assessments.

Mechanistic research integrating multiple biological aging measures—including epigenetic clocks (DNA methylation-based aging markers), telomere length, transcriptomic aging signatures, proteomic aging markers, and metabolomic profiles—would provide more comprehensive characterization of PFAS effects on aging processes than any single biomarker (Chen et al., 2024; Fiorito et al., 2024). Multi-omics approaches can identify molecular pathways through which PFAS exposures influence biological aging and reveal whether different aging measures show concordant or discordant associations. Belsky et al. (2017) demonstrated that various aging measures capture partially overlapping but distinct aspects of the aging process, suggesting that comprehensive assessment requires multiple complementary approaches.

Intervention studies examining the impact of PFAS exposure reduction on biological aging trajectories would provide the strongest evidence for causal relationships and inform preventive strategies. Natural experiments leveraging communities that transitioned from contaminated to clean drinking water sources, or occupational cohorts with reduced workplace PFAS exposures following regulatory changes, could provide quasi-experimental evidence on reversibility of PFAS-associated aging effects. Such studies would also inform policy decisions about the urgency and magnitude of benefits from PFAS remediation efforts.

Mendelian randomization studies using genetic variants associated with PFAS concentrations as instrumental variables could strengthen causal inference by addressing confounding, though identifying suitable genetic instruments with sufficient strength and validity may be challenging (Schooling et al., 2025). Genetic variants in PFAS transporters, metabolizing enzymes, and excretion pathways could potentially serve as instruments, though concerns about pleiotropy (genetic variants affecting outcomes through pathways independent of PFAS exposure) require careful consideration.

## Reconciling Paradoxical Findings

### Non-Monotonic Dose-Response and Hormesis

The possibility of non-monotonic dose-response relationships deserves serious consideration as a potential explanation for inconsistent findings across studies. Hormesis, characterized by beneficial effects at low doses but adverse effects at higher doses (or vice versa), has been documented for various environmental chemicals and pharmaceutical agents. Kang et al. (2024) reported inverted U-shaped associations between PFOS and age-related macular degeneration, demonstrating the empirical occurrence of non-monotonic PFAS relationships in NHANES data.

Multiple biological mechanisms could generate hormetic or non-monotonic PFAS dose-response curves. At low concentrations, PFAS might activate adaptive stress response pathways—including antioxidant enzyme induction, heat shock protein expression, and DNA repair mechanisms—that transiently enhance cellular resilience. These adaptive responses could provide temporary protection against biological aging markers while failing to prevent long-term accumulation of molecular damage that ultimately accelerates aging and disease. At higher concentrations, PFAS toxicity may overwhelm adaptive capacity, leading to clearly adverse outcomes.

Receptor-mediated effects provide another mechanistic basis for non-monotonicity. PFAS compounds activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that regulate lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation (Tancreda et al., 2025). PPAR activation exhibits complex dose-response patterns, with moderate activation potentially beneficial for metabolic health but excessive activation promoting hepatotoxicity and metabolic dysregulation. If different PFAS compounds exhibit partial agonist or antagonist activities at relevant receptors, mixture effects could become highly non-linear and concentration-dependent.

### Threshold Effects and Exposure Range Considerations

The concentration ranges of PFAS exposure in our study population (NHANES 2005-2012) may differ from those in Yan et al. (2025) or other study populations, potentially explaining divergent findings if threshold effects operate. If adverse biological aging effects manifest only above specific PFAS concentration thresholds, studies examining populations with predominantly sub-threshold exposures might observe null or paradoxical inverse associations driven by confounding or selection biases. Conversely, if our study population included a higher proportion of individuals with very elevated PFAS concentrations, non-linear relationships could generate unexpected association patterns.

The temporal decline in PFAS concentrations following industry phase-outs represents an important consideration. NHANES data show substantial decreases in PFOA and PFOS concentrations between the early 2000s and 2010s (Botelho et al., 2025; McAdam et al., 2024), raising questions about whether exposure-outcome relationships characterized during periods of higher exposure generalize to contemporary lower-exposure settings. If PFAS effects on biological aging exhibit threshold dynamics, current population exposure levels might fall below critical thresholds for detectable effects, though low-level chronic exposure effects on long-term aging trajectories remain uncertain.

### Time-Dependent Effects and Latency Periods

Biological aging represents a gradual, multi-decade process influenced by exposures throughout the life course. The impact of PFAS exposure on biological aging may depend not only on current exposure levels but also on exposure timing, duration, and developmental windows of susceptibility. Niemiec et al. (2023) demonstrated that prenatal PFAS exposure was associated with epigenetic age acceleration in umbilical cord blood, suggesting that early-life exposures may program accelerated aging trajectories that manifest across the lifespan. Similarly, Khan et al. (2025) documented effects of gestational PFAS exposure on placental health and function, highlighting potential developmental origins of adult disease and aging.

If critical windows of PFAS susceptibility occur during prenatal development, childhood, or adolescence, cross-sectional studies of adult exposure may inadequately capture the full spectrum of PFAS effects on biological aging. Individuals with high current PFAS concentrations may have experienced different early-life exposure patterns than those with low current concentrations, and these life course exposure profiles—not captured by single adult measurements—may be the primary determinants of biological aging rates. Longitudinal studies with repeated PFAS measurements from birth through older adulthood would be required to fully characterize these time-dependent relationships.

## Broader Context of Environmental Aging Research

### Multiple Environmental Exposures and Cumulative Risk

PFAS exposure rarely occurs in isolation; individuals are simultaneously exposed to multiple environmental chemicals including heavy metals, phthalates, brominated flame retardants, and other persistent organic pollutants. Boafo et al. (2023) demonstrated combined effects of PFAS and metals on cardiovascular disease risk in NHANES participants, while Odediran et al. (2025) showed that dietary patterns mediate associations between PFAS-metal mixtures and cardiovascular outcomes. These studies highlight the importance of considering cumulative environmental exposures and their interactive effects on biological aging.

Fei et al. (2025) reported that oxidative stress markers and inflammatory biomarkers—including lymphocyte percentages and albumin levels that also contribute to PhenoAge—mediate relationships between brominated flame retardant exposure and obesity. This finding suggests that different environmental chemical classes may influence biological aging through shared mechanistic pathways, creating opportunities for synergistic or antagonistic interactions. Comprehensive assessment of environmental aging determinants requires integrated exposure assessment across chemical classes and consideration of joint effects.

The concept of the exposome—the totality of environmental exposures across the lifespan—provides a useful framework for understanding how multiple chemical exposures, psychosocial stressors, dietary factors, and built environment characteristics collectively shape biological aging trajectories. Cuevas et al. (2025) demonstrated that neighborhood-level opportunity indicators influence biological aging in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, illustrating how social and environmental contexts operate at multiple scales to determine aging rates. Future PFAS-aging research should adopt exposome perspectives that situate chemical exposures within broader social-environmental contexts.

### Modifiable Factors and Intervention Opportunities

Emerging evidence suggests that lifestyle factors may modify PFAS-associated health risks, providing potential avenues for intervention even in the absence of complete exposure elimination. Yan et al. (2025) reported that caffeine intake moderated associations between PFAS exposure and biological aging, with potential protective effects at moderate consumption levels. Pan et al. (2024) demonstrated that moderate-intensity physical activity reduced the association between serum PFAS concentrations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease risk in NHANES participants, suggesting that health behaviors may mitigate adverse effects of unavoidable environmental exposures.

Dietary antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and anti-inflammatory compounds may counteract PFAS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially slowing biological aging among exposed individuals (He et al., 2025). While these interventions do not address root causes of PFAS contamination, they may provide practical risk reduction strategies for highly exposed populations while longer-term regulatory and remediation efforts proceed. Public health messaging should emphasize both exposure reduction (primary prevention) and resilience-building through healthy lifestyle behaviors (secondary prevention).

## Conclusion of Discussion

This study examined associations between PFAS exposure and biological aging in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, revealing inverse associations that diverge from mechanistic expectations and prior epidemiologic findings. While these results require cautious interpretation given substantial methodological limitations—particularly cross-sectional design, potential survival bias, and residual confounding—they contribute to the growing literature on environmental determinants of biological aging and highlight important research gaps requiring attention. The persistence of associations across progressive covariate adjustment models and the presence of sex-specific and age-specific heterogeneity suggest complex underlying relationships that merit further investigation through prospective longitudinal studies with repeated measurements of exposures, outcomes, and potential mediators.

The discrepancy between our findings and prior literature, rather than representing a definitive refutation of PFAS aging effects, instead underscores the challenges of inferring causal relationships from cross-sectional environmental epidemiology data. Biological aging represents a multifaceted phenotype influenced by genetic predisposition, early-life programming, cumulative environmental exposures, lifestyle behaviors, socioeconomic conditions, and access to healthcare resources. Disentangling the independent contribution of any single environmental exposure—even one as ubiquitous and persistent as PFAS—requires methodological approaches that can address temporality, confounding, selection bias, and measurement error more comprehensively than cross-sectional designs allow.

From a public health perspective, the weight of evidence from mechanistic research, animal toxicology, and human health outcome studies supports continued efforts to reduce PFAS exposure through regulatory action, technological innovation, and individual behavioral change. The inverse associations observed in our study should not be interpreted as evidence of PFAS safety, but rather as an empirical illustration of the complexities inherent in environmental aging research and the importance of methodological rigor in drawing conclusions from observational data. Future research employing longitudinal designs, comprehensive exposure assessment, multi-omics biological aging measures, and advanced causal inference methods will be essential for definitively characterizing PFAS effects on human biological aging and informing evidence-based prevention strategies.
