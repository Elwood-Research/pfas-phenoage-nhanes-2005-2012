# PFAS Exposure and PhenoAge Biological Aging

## Research Question

What is the association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and biological aging as measured by PhenoAge in the U.S. adult population?

## Study Objectives

1. **Primary Objective**: Examine the cross-sectional association between serum PFAS concentrations (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) and PhenoAge acceleration.

2. **Secondary Objectives**:
   - Investigate dose-response relationships between individual PFAS compounds and biological aging
   - Assess potential sex-specific effects of PFAS on aging
   - Evaluate the cumulative effect of multiple PFAS exposures
   - Identify vulnerable subpopulations based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity

## Background

PFAS are synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial applications. They are persistent in the environment and bioaccumulate in humans. Emerging evidence suggests that PFAS exposure may accelerate biological aging through mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, and endocrine disruption. PhenoAge is a validated biomarker-based measure of biological aging that captures physiological dysregulation across multiple organ systems.

## Study Significance

This study will contribute to understanding how environmental chemical exposures contribute to accelerated aging at the population level, with implications for public health policy and environmental regulation.

## Expected Outcomes

- Quantified associations between PFAS exposure and biological aging
- Identification of most relevant PFAS compounds for aging outcomes
- Population-attributable fractions for PFAS-related accelerated aging
- Evidence to inform regulatory thresholds
