# Forever Aging: The Impact of PFAS on Biological Aging (PhenoAge) in US Adults

## Research Question
Do elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) accelerate biological aging as measured by the PhenoAge biomarker in US adults?

## Objectives
1. Calculate PhenoAge from NHANES biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, glucose, CRP, lymphocyte %, MCV, RDW, alkaline phosphatase, WBC count)
2. Measure serum PFAS concentrations (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA) from NHANES datasets
3. Examine associations between PFAS exposures and accelerated biological aging
4. Evaluate dose-response relationships and potential effect modification by age, sex, race/ethnicity

## Study Population
US adults aged 20+ years from NHANES cycles with available PFAS and biomarker data

## Public Health Significance
PFAS are persistent environmental contaminants with ubiquitous human exposure. Understanding their role in biological aging could inform regulatory policies and public health interventions to reduce exposure and mitigate age-related disease burden.
