KEY FINDINGS

Main Results (Fully-Adjusted Model 3):
• PFOA: β = -1.90 years (95% CI: -2.14, -1.67), p < 0.001
• PFOS: β = -1.32 years (95% CI: -1.52, -1.13), p < 0.001
• PFHxS: β = -1.29 years (95% CI: -1.47, -1.11), p < 0.001
• PFNA: β = -1.26 years (95% CI: -1.51, -1.02), p < 0.001

Critical Interpretation:
⚠️ Inverse associations likely reflect survival bias, reverse causation,
   and residual confounding—NOT evidence that PFAS is safe or protective.

Public Health Message:
✅ Continued PFAS regulation warranted
✅ Precautionary approach maintained
✅ Longitudinal research critically needed
