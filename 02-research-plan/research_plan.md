## Study Rationale

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with extensive industrial and consumer applications, including non-stick cookware, water-resistant textiles, food packaging, and firefighting foams. These "forever chemicals" exhibit remarkable environmental persistence and bioaccumulate in human tissues, with estimated half-lives ranging from 2-5 years for shorter-chain compounds to 3-8 years for legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Mounting evidence indicates that PFAS exposure contributes to adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, kidney dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation, and immune suppression. A landmark 2025 study by Yan et al. provided the first direct epidemiological evidence linking PFAS exposure to accelerated biological aging in a nationally representative sample, demonstrating significant positive associations between PFHxS and both KDM-BA (β=0.56) and PhenoAge (β=0.46), as well as mixture effects on biological aging metrics. Biological aging represents a more precise indicator of physiological decline than chronological age, capturing the cumulative burden of molecular and cellular damage across organ systems. PhenoAge, a validated biomarker-based measure of biological aging developed by Levine et al. (2018), incorporates clinical chemistry and hematological parameters to predict mortality and disease risk more accurately than chronological age alone. Understanding the relationship between environmental chemical exposures and biological aging trajectories is critical for informing regulatory policy, identifying vulnerable populations, and developing intervention strategies to mitigate the public health burden of accelerated aging in environmentally exposed communities.

## Primary Hypothesis

### H1: Main Effect Hypothesis

**Higher serum concentrations of individual PFAS compounds (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) are positively associated with PhenoAge acceleration, independent of chronological age and established confounders.**

**Justification**: The landmark study by Yan et al. (2025) demonstrated significant associations between PFHxS and PhenoAge (β=0.46, 95% CI: 0.08-0.83) in 6,846 NHANES participants. Mechanistic studies suggest that PFAS induce oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic inflammation—pathways implicated in cellular senescence and biological aging. The specific PFAS compounds selected (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) represent the most consistently measured legacy PFAS across NHANES cycles with sufficient detection frequencies for epidemiologic analysis. These compounds vary in carbon chain length and functional groups, potentially conferring differential toxicity profiles that warrant individual assessment.

**Expected Effect Size**: Based on Yan et al. (2025), we expect beta coefficients in the range of 0.3-0.6 years of PhenoAge acceleration per log-unit increase in PFAS concentration, corresponding to approximately 0.2-0.4 standard deviations of the PhenoAge distribution.

---

## Secondary Hypotheses

### H2: Dose-Response Relationship

**The association between PFAS exposure and PhenoAge acceleration follows a monotonic or non-monotonic dose-response pattern, with stronger effects observed at higher exposure levels.**

**Justification**: Kang et al. (2024) observed non-monotonic dose-response relationships between PFOS and age-related macular degeneration, suggesting potential threshold or hormetic effects. Nonlinear relationships between PFAS and biological aging were also reported by Yan et al. (2025). The evaluation of dose-response patterns will inform regulatory threshold-setting and risk assessment approaches.

**Expected Pattern**: Linear or supra-linear dose-response with potential plateau effects at higher concentrations consistent with receptor-mediated toxicity mechanisms.

### H3: Sex-Specific Effects

**The association between PFAS exposure and PhenoAge acceleration is modified by sex, with stronger associations observed in females compared to males.**

**Justification**: Wu et al. (2024) demonstrated that PFAS exposure is associated with earlier menopause and decreased estradiol in females, suggesting sex-specific endocrine disruption. Females may exhibit differential PFAS toxicokinetics due to body composition differences and hormonal influences on metabolism. Postmenopausal women demonstrate higher PFAS retention due to reduced excretion capacity, potentially increasing vulnerability to aging-accelerating effects.

**Expected Effect**: 20-40% stronger associations in females, particularly postmenopausal women, based on sex-specific endocrine disruption and toxicokinetic differences.

### H4: Mixture Effects

**Combined exposure to multiple PFAS compounds exhibits synergistic or additive effects on PhenoAge acceleration beyond the contributions of individual compounds.**

**Justification**: Yan et al. (2025) reported that PFAS mixture exposure was positively associated with biological aging (KDM-BA: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.04-1.45; PhenoAge: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.55-1.03), with mixture effects exceeding individual compound associations. Humans are simultaneously exposed to complex mixtures of PFAS through multiple exposure pathways, and traditional single-chemical risk assessment approaches may underestimate total exposure impact. Adetunji & Obeng-Gyasi (2025) demonstrated cumulative kidney toxicity from PFAS mixtures, supporting the biological plausibility of mixture effects.

**Expected Effect**: Mixture indices will demonstrate stronger associations (20-50% larger effect sizes) compared to individual PFAS compounds, indicating synergistic or additive toxicity.

### H5: Vulnerable Subpopulations

**Older adults (≥60 years) and individuals with lower socioeconomic status demonstrate heightened susceptibility to PFAS-associated PhenoAge acceleration.**

**Justification**: Older adults exhibit reduced renal clearance of PFAS, leading to higher body burdens and prolonged exposure durations. Lower socioeconomic status is associated with both higher environmental PFAS exposure (due to residence near industrial sources and consumption of packaged/processed foods) and limited access to resources that might mitigate exposure effects. Haruna & Obeng-Gyasi (2024) identified combined PFAS and metals exposure as risk factors for chronic kidney disease, suggesting that age-related decline in renal function may amplify PFAS toxicity.

**Expected Effect**: 30-50% stronger associations in adults ≥60 years and those below 200% of the federal poverty level, reflecting differential vulnerability and exposure patterns.

## Study Design Description

### Design Framework

This study employs a cross-sectional design utilizing pooled data from five NHANES survey cycles (1999-2000, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012). The cross-sectional approach is appropriate for examining associations between biomarker-measured exposures (PFAS serum concentrations) and biomarker-measured outcomes (PhenoAge calculated from clinical parameters) in a large, nationally representative sample. While temporal relationships cannot be definitively established, PFAS bioaccumulation over years to decades and the chronic nature of biological aging processes support the biological plausibility of exposure-outcome associations observed in cross-sectional analyses.

### Population and Sampling

The study population consists of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians aged 18 years and older who participated in NHANES during the specified cycles and provided serum samples for PFAS quantification. NHANES employs a complex, multistage probability sampling design to ensure representativeness of the U.S. population. PFAS measurements were conducted in subsamples of participants, requiring the application of appropriate sample weights for population-level inference.

### Eligible Survey Cycles

| Cycle | Years | PFAS Dataset | Key Compounds Available |
|-------|-------|--------------|------------------------|
| A | 1999-2000 | SSPFC_A | PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS |
| D | 2005-2006 | PFC_D | PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA |
| E | 2007-2008 | PFC_E | PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA |

## Variable Definitions

### Primary Exposure Variables

#### Individual PFAS Compounds

| Variable | NHANES Name | Description | Units | Detection Limit (Typical) |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| PFOA | LBXPFOA | Perfluorooctanoic acid | ng/mL | 0.1 ng/mL |
| PFOS | LBXPFOS | Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid | ng/mL | 0.2 ng/mL |
| PFHxS | LBXPFHS | Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid | ng/mL | 0.1 ng/mL |
| PFNA | LBXPFNA | Perfluorononanoic acid | ng/mL | 0.1 ng/mL |

**Exposure Assessment**: Serum PFAS concentrations will be analyzed as:
1. **Continuous variables**: Natural log-transformed concentrations to address right-skewed distributions
2. **Categorical variables**: Tertiles or quartiles based on the weighted distribution
3. **Standardized variables**: Z-scores for comparison across compounds

**Values Below Detection Limits**: Values below the limit of detection (LOD) will be imputed as LOD/√2, consistent with standard NHANES analytical practices.

#### PFAS Mixture Indices

1. **Summed PFAS**: Sum of molar concentrations for detected compounds
2. **Principal Component 1**: First principal component from PCA of correlated PFAS
3. **Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS)**: Data-driven weights for mixture components

### Primary Outcome Variable

#### PhenoAge (Biological Aging)

PhenoAge will be calculated using the validated algorithm developed by Levine et al. (2018), incorporating chronological age and nine clinical biomarkers:

**PhenoAge Components**:

| Component | NHANES Variable | Dataset | Description | Units |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Albumin | LBDSALSI | BIOPRO | Albumin | g/L |
| Creatinine | LBDSCRSI | BIOPRO | Creatinine | μmol/L |
| Glucose | LBDGLUSI | GLU | Fasting glucose | mmol/L |
| CRP | LBXCRP | CRP | C-reactive protein | mg/L |
| Lymphocyte % | LBXLYPCT | CBC | Lymphocyte percentage | % |
| MCV | LBXMCVSI | CBC | Mean corpuscular volume | fL |
| RDW | LBXRDW | CBC | Red cell distribution width | % |
| ALP | LBXSAPSI | BIOPRO | Alkaline phosphatase | U/L |
| WBC | LBXWBCSI | CBC | White blood cell count | 10⁹/L |

**Calculation Method**: The PhenoAge algorithm applies a Gompertz proportional hazards model with coefficients derived from mortality prediction models:

```
PhenoAge = 141.50 + (LN(-0.00553 * LN(1 - MortScore)) / 0.09165)

Where MortScore = 1 - exp(-exp((intercept + Σ(βi × biomarker_i)) / scale))
```

Coefficients will be obtained from the original Levine et al. (2018) publication and applied consistently across all cycles after appropriate unit conversions.

**PhenoAge Acceleration**: The primary outcome will be PhenoAge acceleration, calculated as the residual from regressing PhenoAge on chronological age (positive values indicate biological age older than chronological age).

## Confounding Control Strategy

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Framework

A DAG will be constructed to identify minimally sufficient adjustment sets for estimating the total effect of PFAS exposure on PhenoAge acceleration. Based on the literature and biological plausibility, the following confounding domains will be addressed:

### Confounder Identification

| Confounder Domain | Variables | Justification |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Demographics** | Age, Sex, Race/Ethnicity | Associated with both PFAS exposure (environmental disparities) and biological aging; age is a component of PhenoAge calculation |
| **Socioeconomic Status** | Education, PIR | Associated with exposure sources (occupational, residential) and health outcomes |
| **Health Behaviors** | Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity, BMI | Associated with PFAS exposure patterns (dietary sources) and biological aging processes |
| **Chronic Conditions** | Diabetes, Hypertension, CVD | Potential intermediates; handled via exclusion or sensitivity analyses |
| **Renal Function** | eGFR | Critical confounder as PFAS are excreted renally; lower eGFR associated with higher PFAS and accelerated aging |

### Adjustment Strategy

**Primary Model (Minimally Adjusted)**:
- Age (continuous, restricted cubic spline)
- Sex (indicator)
- Race/Ethnicity (indicators)

**Secondary Model (Fully Adjusted)**:
- Demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity)
- Socioeconomic (education, PIR)
- Health behaviors (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, BMI)
- Renal function (eGFR, continuous)
- Survey cycle indicators

**Tertiary Model (Sensitivity)**:
- Exclude participants with diagnosed diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease to reduce reverse causation concerns

### Handling of Mediating Variables

Variables on the causal pathway between PFAS exposure and biological aging (e.g., inflammation markers, oxidative stress biomarkers) will not be included in primary models to avoid overadjustment bias. These will be explored in secondary mediation analyses if data availability permits.

## Expected Results Based on Literature

### Primary Findings

Based on the landmark study by Yan et al. (2025) and supporting mechanistic literature, we expect:

1. **Positive associations** between all four PFAS compounds (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA) and PhenoAge acceleration, with strongest associations for PFHxS based on prior findings.

2. **Effect magnitude** of approximately 0.3-0.6 years of biological age acceleration per doubling of PFAS concentration (log-scale coefficient interpretation).

3. **Statistical significance** at the α=0.05 level for at least two of the four PFAS compounds, with consistent directional effects across all compounds.

### Secondary Findings

1. **Dose-Response**: Linear or supra-linear dose-response relationships, with potential threshold effects at lower exposure levels.

2. **Sex Differences**: Stronger associations in females, particularly those postmenopausal, reflecting differential toxicokinetics and endocrine sensitivity.

3. **Mixture Effects**: PFAS mixture indices will demonstrate stronger associations than individual compounds, indicating cumulative toxicity.

4. **Vulnerable Subgroups**: Enhanced susceptibility in older adults and lower SES populations, supporting environmental justice concerns.

### Consistency with Prior Literature

The expected findings are consistent with:
- Yan et al. (2025): PFAS and biological aging in NHANES
- Wang et al. (2025): PFAS and cardiovascular risk
- Adetunji & Obeng-Gyasi (2025): PFAS and kidney dysfunction
- Tancreda et al. (2025): PFAS hepatotoxicity mechanisms
